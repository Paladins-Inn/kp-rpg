## Abstract


## License
The license for the software is LGPL 3.0 or newer. 


## Architecture

tl;dr (ok, only the bullshit bingo words):
- Immutable Objects (where frameworks allow)
- Relying heavily on generated code
- 100 % test coverage of human generated code
- Every line of code not written is bug free!

Code test coverage for human generated code should be 100%, machinge generated code is considered bugfree until proven 
wrong. But every line that needs not be written is a bug free line without need to test it. So aim for not writing code.


## Distribution
The software is distributed via quay.io. You find the images as

* quay.io/klenkes74/kp-rpg-discord-bot:1.0.0 (stable release)
* quay.io/klenkes74/kp-rpg-discord-bot:latest (bleeding edge)


## Note from the author
This software is meant do be perfected not finished.

If someone is interested in getting it faster, we may team up. I'm open for that. But be warned: I want to do it 
_right_. So no short cuts to get faster. And be prepared for some basic discussions about the architecture or software 
design :-).
